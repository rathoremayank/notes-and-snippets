# The four broad types of testing are: 

## 1. Unit Testing (White Box)
## 2. Integration Testing or String Testing
## 3. System Testing (Black Box)
## 4. User Acceptance Testing or Acceptance Testing

### Brief explanation on above testing techniques

## 1. Unit Testing
UNIT TESTING is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object. In SDLC, STLC, V Model, Unit testing is first level of testing done before integration testing. 

Unit testing is a WhiteBox testing technique that is usually performed by the developer. Though, in a practical world due to time crunch or reluctance of developers to tests, QA engineers also do unit testing. 


## 2. Integration Testing or String Testing
INTEGRATION TESTING is defined as a type of testing where software modules are integrated logically and tested as a group. A typical software project consists of multiple software modules, coded by different programmers. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose defects in the interaction between these software modules when they are integrated. 

Integration Testing focuses on checking data communication amongst these modules. Hence it is also termed as 'I & T' (Integration and Testing), 'String Testing' and sometimes. 


## 3. System Testing
SYSTEM TESTING is a level of testing that validates the complete and fully integrated software product. The purpose of a system test is to evaluate the end-to-end system specifications. Usually, the software is only one element of a larger computer-based system. Ultimately, the software is interfaced with other software/hardware systems. System Testing is actually a series of different tests whose sole purpose is to exercise the full computer-based system. 


## 4. User Acceptance Testing or Acceptance Testing
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is a type of testing performed by the end user or the client to verify/accept the software system before moving the software application to the production environment. UAT is done in the final phase of testing after functional, integration and system testing is done.

The main Purpose of UAT is to validate end to end business flow. It does not focus on cosmetic errors, spelling mistakes or system testing. User Acceptance Testing is carried out in a separate testing environment with production-like data setup. It is kind of black box testing where two or more end-users will be involved.


## White Box and Black Box Testing
White box testing is the testing of the internal workings or code of a software application. In contrast, black box or System Testing is the opposite. System test involves the external workings of the software from the user's perspective.
